### System

Drone is tested on the following versions of Ubuntu:

* Ubuntu Precise 12.04 (LTS) (64-bit)
* Ubuntu Raring 13.04 (64 bit)

Drone's only external dependency is the latest version of Docker (0.8)

### Setup

Drone is packaged and distributed as a debian file. You can download an install
using the following commands:

```sh
$ wget http://downloads.drone.io/latest/drone.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i drone.deb
$ sudo start drone
```

Once Drone is running (by default on :80) navigate to **http://localhost:80/install**
and follow the steps in the setup wizard.

**IMPORTANT** You will also need a GitHub Client ID and Secret:

* Register a new application https://github.com/settings/applications
* Set the homepage URL to http://$YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/
* Set the callback URL to http://$YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/auth/login/github
* Copy the Client ID and Secret into the Drone admin console http://localhost:80/account/admin/settings

I'm working on a getting started video. Having issues with volume, but hopefully
you can still get a feel for the steps:

**Using MySQL**

By default, Drone use sqlite as its database storage. To use MySQL/MariaDB instead, use `-driver` flag
and set it to `mysql`. You will need to set your DSN (`-datasource`) in this form: 
```
    user:password@tcp(hostname:port)/dbname?parseTime=true
```
Change it according to your database settings. The parseTime above is required since drone using
`time.Time` to represents `TIMESTAMP` data. Please refer to [1] for more options on mysql driver.

You may also need to tweak some innodb options, especially if you're using `utf8mb4` collation type.
```
    innodb_file_format = Barracuda
    innodb_file_per_table = On
    innodb_large_prefix = On
```
Please consult to the MySQL/MariaDB documentation for further information
regarding large prefix for index column and dynamic row format (which is used in Drone).

### Builds

Drone use a **.drone.yml** configuration file in the root of your
repository to run your build:

```
image: mischief/docker-golang
env:
  - GOPATH=/var/cache/drone
script:
  - go build
  - go test -v
services:
  - redis
notify:
  email:
    recipients:
      - brad@drone.io
      - burke@drone.io
```

### Images

In the above example we used a custom Docker image from index.docker.io **mischief/docker-golang**

Drone also provides official build images. These images are configured specifically for CI and
have many common software packages pre-installed (git, xvfb, firefox, libsqlite, etc).

Official Drone images are referenced in the **.drone.yml** by an alias:

```sh
image: go1.2   # same as bradrydzewski/go:1.2
```

Here is a list of our official images:

```sh
# these two are base images. all Drone images are built on top of these
# these are BIG (~3GB) so make sure you have a FAST internet connection
docker pull bradrydzewski/ubuntu
docker pull bradrydzewski/base

# clojure images
docker pull bradrydzewski/lein             # image: lein

# dart images
docker pull bradrydzewski/dart:stable      # image: dart

docker pull bradrydzewski/erlang:R16B02    # image: erlangR16B02
docker pull bradrydzewski/erlang:R16B01    # image: erlangR16B01

# gcc images (c/c++)
docker pull bradrydzewski/gcc:4.6          # image: gcc4.6
docker pull bradrydzewski/gcc:4.8          # image: gcc4.8

# go images

docker pull bradrydzewski/java:openjdk7    # image: openjdk7
docker pull bradrydzewski/java:oraclejdk7  # image: oraclejdk7
docker pull bradrydzewski/java:oraclejdk8  # image: oraclejdk8

# node images
docker pull bradrydzewski/node:0.10        # image node0.10
docker pull bradrydzewski/node:0.8         # image node0.8

# php images

# scala images
docker pull bradrydzewski/scala:2.10.3     # image: scala2.10.3
docker pull bradrydzewski/scala:2.9.3      # image: scala2.9.3

```

### Environment

Drone clones your repository into a Docker container
at the following location:

```
/var/cache/drone/src/github.com/$owner/$name
```

Please take this into consideration when setting up your build commands, or
if you are using a custom Docker image.

### Git Command Options

You can specify the `--depth` option of the `git clone` command (default value is `50`):

```
git:
  depth: 1
```

### Deployments

Drone can trigger a deployment at the successful completion of your build:

```
deploy:
  heroku:
    app: safe-island-6261

publish:
  s3:
    acl: public-read
    region: us-east-1
    bucket: downloads.drone.io
    access_key: C24526974F365C3B
    secret_key: 2263c9751ed084a68df28fd2f658b127
    source: /tmp/drone.deb
    target: latest/

  swift:
    username: someuser
    password: 030e39a1278a18828389b194b93211aa
    auth_url: https://identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0
    region: DFW
    container: drone
    source: /tmp/drone.deb
    target: latest/drone.deb
    branch: master

```

Drone currently has these `deploy` and `publish` plugins implemented (more to come!):

**deploy**
- [heroku](#docs)
- [git](#docs)
- [modulus](#docs)
- [nodejitsu](#docs)
- [ssh](#docs)
- [tsuru](#docs)
- [bash](#docs)

**publish**
- [Amazon s3](#docs)
- [OpenStack Swift](#docs)
- [PyPI](#docs)

Publish plugins can be limited to a specific branch using the `branch` configuration
as seen above in the `swift` example. If you do not specify a `branch` all branches
will be published, with the exception of Pull Requests.

### Notifications

Drone can trigger email, hipchat and web hook notification at the beginning and
completion of your build:

```
notify:
  email:
    recipients:
      - brad@drone.io
      - burke@drone.io

  webhook:
    on_success: true
    on_failure: true
    urls:
      - http://my-deploy-hook.com

  hipchat:
    room: support
    token: 3028700e5466d375
    on_started: true
    on_success: true
    on_failure: true
```

### Databases

Drone can launch database containers for your build:

```
services:
  - cassandra
  - couchdb
  - couchdb:1.0
  - couchdb:1.4
  - couchdb:1.5
  - elasticsearch
  - elasticsearch:0.20
  - elasticsearch:0.90
  - neo4j
  - neo4j:1.9
  - mongodb
  - mongodb:2.2
  - mongodb:2.4
  - mysql
  - mysql:5.5
  - postgres
  - postgres:9.1
  - rabbitmq
  - rabbitmq:3.2
  - redis
  - riak
  - zookeeper
```

If you omit the version, Drone will launch the latest version of the database. (For example, if you set `mongodb`, Drone will launch MongoDB 2.4.)

You can also launch custom Docker containers using standard docker notation:

```sh
services:
  - dockerfile/rethinkdb # same as dockerfile/rethinkdb:latest
  - barnybug/elasticsearch:1.0.1
```

**NOTE 1:** database and service containers are exposed over TCP connections and
have their own local IP address. If the **socat** utility is installed inside your
Docker image, Drone will automatically proxy localhost connections to the correct
IP address.

**NOTE 2:** avoid running services that use the same ports. For example, don't specify
multiple versions of Elastic Search since the port will already be in use.

### Caching

Drone can persist directories between builds. This should be used for caching dependencies to
decrease overall build time. Examples include your `.npm`, `.m2`, `bundler`, etc.

```
cache:
  - /usr/local/bin/go/pkg
```

This will cache the directory relative to the root directory of your repository:

```
cache:
  - .npm
```

**NOTE:** this is an alpha quality feature and still has some quirks. See https://github.com/drone/drone/issues/147

### Params Injection

You can inject params into .drone.yml.

```
notify:
  hipchat:
    room: {{hipchatRoom}}
    token: {{hipchatToken}}
    on_started: true
    on_success: true
    on_failure: true
```

### Wall display

A wall display for Drone is available as a separate service. See [Drone Wall](https://github.com/drone/drone-wall)
for details.

### Local development

Local Drone setup for development is pretty straightforward.

You will need to clone the repo, install Vagrant and run `vagrant up`.
This command will download base Ubuntu image, setup the virtual machine and build Drone.

Afterwards, you may `vagrant ssh` into the vagrant instance, where docker is already installed and ready to go.

Once in the vagrant instance, run `make run`, the visit http://localhost:8080/install in your browser.

The Makefile has other targets so check that out for more build, test, run configurations.
